# Reflection
## <span style="color: #6D2DBF">  First Program </span>
```
a program that takes the name of a class and the type of its constructor parameters as input strings and checks whether this class has a constructor with specified parameters or not. Then if such a constructor exists, it creates a new object of that class and changes the values of its private fields using Reflection and displays new values.
