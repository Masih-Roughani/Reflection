# Reflection
## <span style="color: #6D2DBF"> First Program </span>
```
A program that takes the name of a class and the type of its constructor parameters as input strings and checks whether this class has a constructor with specified parameters or not. Then if such a constructor exists, it creates a new object of that class and changes the values of its private fields using Reflection and displays new values.
```
## <span style="color: #6D2DBF"> Second Program </span>
```
A program that creates an object of an arbitrary class and lists all the methods of that class along with their input parameters and return type. Then calling one of the methods dynamically and displaying the result.
```
## <span style="color: #6D2DBF"> Third Program </span>
```
A programs that creates an object of an arbitrary class and lists all the private fields of that class and displays their values. Then changes the value of a field dynamically and display the new value. Also, the application dynamically detects the type of the field and applies the changes with the type.
```
## <span style="color: #6D2DBF"> Fourth Program </span>
```
A program that implements an interface using Reflection and dynamically returns its methods with default values. Also, it should simulate the default methods when called so that they can return arbitrary values.
```
## <span style="color: #6D2DBF"> Fifth Program </span>
```
A program that loads an arbitrary class and lists all its constructors. Then, uses one of these constructors, creates a new object and dynamically changes the value of one of its private fields. In addition, calls a method dynamically and displays the result.
